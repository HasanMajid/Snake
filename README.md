# Snake

This is my snake game I created using Pygame and OOP. The reason for this project is to see what it is like creating a game using just OOP because I have heard many bad things about OOP and wanted to test myself how my experience would be.

After completing the snake game, I can definitely say that creating objects definitely helps to manage the state of the game. It helps to separate different states such as the snake, and food.
